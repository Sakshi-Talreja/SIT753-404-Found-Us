# SIT753-404-Found-Us

## Overview
SIT753-404-Found-Us is a web application project developed as part of a team-based assignment for the SIT753 course. This project focuses on creating a responsive and user-friendly web interface, leveraging modern frontend technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. The repository contains the source code, assets, and configuration files necessary to build and deploy the application.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides an intuitive user interface with smooth navigation and dynamic content updates.
- **Modular Codebase**: Organized structure with reusable components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Tested to ensure consistent performance across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For semantic and accessible markup.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For interactive functionality and dynamic content.
- **Framework/Libraries** (if applicable, e.g., React, Bootstrap, etc.):
  - [Specify framework/library, e.g., React for component-based architecture]
  - [Specify CSS framework, e.g., Bootstrap for pre-built styles]
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and collaboration.
- **Build Tools** (if applicable, e.g., Webpack, Vite, etc.):
  - [Specify build tool, if used, for bundling and optimization]

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sakshi-Talreja/SIT753-404-Found-Us.git
   cd SIT753-404-Found-Us
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (if applicable, e.g., for Node.js-based projects):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - For a static site, open `index.html` in a browser.
   - For projects with a development server (if applicable):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
     Access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

## Usage
- **Development**: Modify the files in the `css/`, `js/`, or `assets/` directories to update styles, functionality, or resources.
- **Testing**: Ensure the application is tested across different devices and browsers to verify responsiveness and compatibility.
- **Deployment**: Host the application on a static hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Code Quality Guidelines
As a senior frontend engineer, the following best practices are recommended for this project:
- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS Organization**: Follow a methodology like BEM or SMACSS for maintainable styles.
- **JavaScript Modularity**: Write modular, reusable JavaScript code with clear function and variable naming.
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize CSS and JavaScript files, optimize images, and leverage lazy loading where applicable.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Ensure ARIA attributes are used where necessary and test with screen readers.
- **Version Control**: Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages (e.g., `git commit -m "Add responsive navigation bar"`).
